# Hi, I'm Rafael Karcz 👋

I'm a data-driven analyst who loves turning messy, real-world problems into clean, actionable insights. I care about systems, small improvements, and tools that scale.

## Current focus ⚡️
I'm honing my data skills with a bias toward practical business impact. Long-term, I want to use data to drive meaningful, positive change. Right now I'm working through the **Python Developer** path on JetBrains’ Hyperskill and a **Coursera AWS Fundamentals** specialization.

## Background 🎓
I completed my **Economics** degree **two years ago** and have been deepening my toolkit across Python, SQL, and analytics engineering since.

## What I believe 👨🏻‍💻
I love coding and creating efficient data workflows, and I’m a proponent of open-source software. You'll find projects here showcasing **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Bash**.

For data visualization, see both:
- My **Power BI** report repos here on GitHub, and
- Selected work on **[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rafaelkarcz/vizzes)**

## Skills & tools 🧰
- **Languages:** Python | SQL | Bash  
- **Analytics & Viz:** Power BI (DAX | Power Query) | Tableau  
- **Data stack:** pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | BeautifulSoup | Requests | SQLAlchemy  
- **Environment & tooling:** Power BI Desktop | Git/GitHub | Linux & Windows/WSL | Conda/venv | Jupyter | VS Code
- **Practices:** Data cleaning | feature engineering | automation/ETL | dashboard design | documentation-first mindset

## Project highlights 🚀

  Star schema, robust DAX measures (AOV, T12M, Time Intelligence), KPI tiles, drill-throughs, and clean UX; focused on performance and business storytelling.
  
- **[Python — Investor Calculator](https://github.com/RafaelKarcz/InvestorCalculator)**  
  CLI/Notebook tool to evaluate investment scenarios (lump-sum vs DCA, fees, taxes, FX), with charts and sensitivity analysis.
  
- **[SQL — Expense Tracker](https://github.com/RafaelKarcz/ExpenseTracker)**  
  End-to-end SQL project modeling expenses: clean, categorize, and aggregate transactions; views for monthly burn, vendor analysis, and rolling 12-month trends.
