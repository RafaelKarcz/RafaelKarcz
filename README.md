## Hi, I'm Rafael Karcz 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a data-driven enthusiast with a strong passion for data science, data analysis, and the pursuit of knowledge!

🔭 Currently, I'm honing my skills in data science, focusing on practical applications in business analysis and data analysis. I’m particularly interested in using data to solve global problems and contribute to transformational changes. But this journey will take me a few years for sure. For now, I will focus on working through the Data Analyst Bootcamp by Alex Freberg (aka Alex The Analyst).

🎓 I recently completed my degree in economics and am preparing to further my education in data science, with an eye towards specializing in bioinformatics and physics.

👨🏻‍💻 I love coding and creating efficient data workflows, and I’m a proponent of open-source software. You'll find various projects here, showcasing my skills in Python, SQL, and Bash. For my Data Visualization projects, head over to my [Tableau Public site](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rafaelkarcz/vizzes).

📖 You should also know that I am a keen learner. Sounds cheesy and quirky, but I believe that simply sitting down a few minutes a day to learn is a great way to stay optimistic and mentally fit.
