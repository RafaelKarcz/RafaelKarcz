# Hi, I'm Rafael Karcz üëã

I'm a data-driven analyst who loves turning messy, real-world problems into clean, actionable insights. I care about systems, small improvements, and tools that scale.

## Current focus ‚ö°Ô∏è
I'm honing my data skills with a bias toward practical business impact. Long-term, I want to use data to drive meaningful, positive change. Right now I'm working through the **Python Developer** path on JetBrains‚Äô Hyperskill and a **Coursera AWS Fundamentals** specialization.

## Background üéì
I completed my **Economics** degree **two years ago** and have been deepening my toolkit across Python, SQL, and analytics engineering since.

## What I believe üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
I love coding and crafting efficient data workflows in service of sustainable development, and I‚Äôm a proponent of open-source software; you‚Äôll find projects here showcasing **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Bash**.

For data visualization, see both:
- My **Power BI** report repos here on GitHub, and
- Selected work on **[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rafaelkarcz/vizzes)**
